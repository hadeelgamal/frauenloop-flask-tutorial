This is the most basic version of a flask app. Use the following command to start the server

	python run.py

## [.gitignore](.gitignore) 

This tell git to ignore specific files/directories from the repo. 

## [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

This list the files that we require in our virtualenv to run the code

## [run.py](run.py)

This file sets up our server.

## [__init__.py](app/__init__.py)

This is standard file that is needed to create the server

## [views.py](app/views.py)

This is where all the work is done and will be the main file that we will be working on as the project expands.
